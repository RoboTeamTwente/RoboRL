# RoboRL

## What is RoboRL?
RoboRL is RoboTeamTwente's attempt to create a simple, easy-to-use, and scalable reinforcement learning environment for the small size league (SSL).
We use [MuJoCo](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco) as our physics engine and [Brax](https://github.com/google/brax) as our RL framework.
